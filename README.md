# Analyzing-CNN-Fully-Connected-Layers
Analyzing CNN Fully Connected Layers to Identify Interesting Structures and Relevant Neurons

# Jupyter Notebooks Description:

* ## AlexNet.ipynb
  This notebook analyzes the pre-trained AlexNet and extracts distributions and features used later on for generating
  random graphs, clustering and analysis

* ## VGG.ipynb
  This notebook analyzes the pre-trained VGG and extracts distributions and features used later on for generating random
  graphs, clustering and analysis

* ## RandomGraphs.ipynb
  This notebook generates the random networks according to the distributions found previously and computes features used
  for clustering and analysis of the randomly generated networks

* ## Clustering.ipynb
  This notebook runs the clustering algorithms (BIRCH, MeanShift) using the features extracted with previous notebooks

* ## ResultAnalysis.ipynb
  This notebook generates diagrams used to visualize the extracted features in a readable format
